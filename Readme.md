## Latest Version: V2

Lexus-YT-Pro has been updated to version 2 (V2), providing enhanced ad-blocking capabilities and improved user experience.

## Version 2: Enhanced UI and Functionalities

In version 1, the user interface included the `LexusAdSkipper: Activated` indicator above the video, with additional options adjacent to it. However, in version 2, the user experience has been significantly refined for better organization and ease of use.

### Enhanced UI Interface

#### Version 1
- The `LexusAdSkipper: Activated` indicator was displayed persistently above the video player.
- Additional options, such as speed adjustments and other functionalities, were located nearby.

#### Version 2
- A dedicated extension popup has been introduced for a cleaner user interface.
- Users no longer see the `LexusAdSkipper: Activated` indicator and other options cluttering the video player area.
- Users can now control the extension's functionality on-demand by clicking the extension icon to open the popup.

### Enhanced Functionalities

Both versions offer an enhanced ad-blocking experience and improved playback control:

#### Version 1 (Patched)
- Ad blocking capabilities were improved with enhanced ad removal.
- Playback speed adjustments ranged from 0.20x to 3x.
- Users gained the ability to skip only skippable ads.
- A volume boost feature was introduced.

#### Version 2
- The harmful "boast volume" feature has been removed to ensure user safety.
- Playback speed adjustments have been expanded to a wider range of 0.10x to 5x.
- The "loop" option has been removed, as YouTube now provides this by default through right-click on videos.
- All types of ad removal functionalities are now supported, ensuring a seamless ad-free experience.

These enhancements have been designed to provide users with a cleaner, more organized UI and a feature-rich experience, ensuring they have better control over their viewing preferences.
